# The Horizon Studio Library for Kubernetes

Applications, provided by [Horizon Studio](https://hrznstudio.com), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## Before you begin

### Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

The quickest way to setup a Kubernetes cluster is with [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) or [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) using their respective quick-start guides. For setting up Kubernetes on other cloud platforms or bare-metal servers refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

### Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client, you can deploy a Horizon Studio Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise the [Using Helm Guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/using_helm.md) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

As an example, the following command allows you to download and install the `minecraft` chart from this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hrznstudio/playhrzn-k8s
$ helm install ./playhrzn-k8s/charts/minecraft
```
